  prediction via 3D-convolutional neural networks. Journal of chemical information and modeling, 58(2), 287-296.

You will need moleculekit, htmd and pytorch

# Schnet
Uses a modified version of schnetpack which can be found at the modified fork on my profile -> https://github.com/BioFreak95/schnetpack 
Maybe these changes can be added to the original fork in future.

To install, download the fork and use `pip install .` in the directory of schnetpack.
